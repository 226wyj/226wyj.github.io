Hi, there.

My name is Yuejiang Wu, currently a software engineer at [Indeed, inc](https://www.indeed.com/).

My major is computer science, I got my Bachelor's degree at [NEU](https://www.neu.edu.cn/) and Master's degree at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/).

I admire the art of elegant coding, and I'm trying my best to become a better SWE.

Although I'm a slow walker, but I never walk backwards.
